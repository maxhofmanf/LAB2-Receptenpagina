            <p class="main_text">Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a
                buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a
                water bath.</p>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li>To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the
                        digestive
                        biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a
                        bowl,
                        then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip
                        them
                        into
                        the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the
                        fridge
                        for 1
                        hr to set firmly.</li>

                    <li>Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to
                        thicken
                        to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then
                        beat
                        for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and
                        then
                        start
                        to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking
                        for
                        it to
                        be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick
                        enough,
                        continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards,
                        making
                        sure
                        that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert
                        spoon or
                        spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.</li>
                    <li>Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the
                        tin,
                        place
                        the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a
                        serving
                        plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food
                        processor
                        with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake,
                        and
                        pour the purée over the top.</li>
